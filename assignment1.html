        If children don't frequently experience severe illness with COVID-19, why do they need a COVID-19 vaccine?
    </h1>
    <p>
        While rare, some children can become seriously ill with COVID-19 after getting the virus that causes COVID-19. A COVID-19 vaccine might prevent your child from getting the virus that causes COVID-19. It also may prevent your child from becoming seriously ill or having to stay in the hospital due to the COVID-19 virus.
